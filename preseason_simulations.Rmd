# What is this? {-}

Which teams are most likely to win their conference in `r params$input_season`? Make the playoff? Win the national championship?

This notebook details results from simulating the `r params$input_season` college football season before any actual games are played. We use historical college football play by play and game data in order to develop a model for simulating upcoming games. All data is from collegefootballdata.com.

# `r params$input_season` Team Ratings

The following table displays each team's **Rating**, which is estimated from their previous season's Elo Rating, offensive efficiency, defensive efficiency, and a moving average of their composite recruiting score. These ratings are used to simulate the outcome of each game in an Elo framework, adjusting for home field advantage.

These ratings are **Week 0** ratings because they rely only on information from previous seasons. As the season progresses, these ratings will update for each team as we gain new information based on the results of games (with the exception of recruiting, which is computed at the yearly level).

```{r rank teams after adjustment}

The following table shows each team's strength of schedule (SOS), predicted record (for the regular season), probability of making a bowl, winning their conference championship, and making/winning in the playoff.

These results are based on simulating the 2022 season 1000 times and counting the number of simulations in which a team achieved each outcome.
